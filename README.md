Build Windows-based ISO's from installation media sources and folders

ISO Builder makes creating Windows Installation and WinPE ISO's a piece of cake. It will allow you to build an ISO from source files (please note, this will only work for Windows based source files - Linux support may be added down the road).

### Steps

1. Click the **Souce Files** button to select your installation media source (such as a Windows installation DVD or your ISO build folder)
2. Click the **Path to Save ISO** button to select the output path of the ISO file
3. Type the desired name of the ISO you are building (remember to add the .iso extension - the **Build ISO** button will not work until this is complete)
4. Click **Build ISO**

That's all there is! Please submit any bug reports to the issues within this repository.

***As a side note - some Antivirus software will prevent copying files and executables that they flag as malicious. Make sure to whitelist your build/source folder if you run into problems. I have not had issues with this (Even with McAfee Virus Scan Enterprise), but it is possible.***
